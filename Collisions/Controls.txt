Controls

Note: Several things must be #defined to be enabled. These can be found in "sphere_JK_OO_particle.h" which 
include such things as #define DRAW_POLY_DEBUG, #define GRID, #define HGRID. Not all of these are functioning and
try not to use things that would obviously clash such as GRID and HGRID at the same time.
